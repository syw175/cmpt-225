// Constructors and Destructors

/* Generally, every class that makes use of dynamically allocated memory
 * should have at least two constructors:
 *   - a default constructor and 
 *   - a copy constructor that creates a distinct copy of the given object
 * (even if the client code does not make use of all of these constructors).
 */
// Description: Default constructor

template <class ElementType>
List<ElementType>::List()
{	
   // cout << "List Default constructor" << endl; // For testing purposes!
}


/* Note the parameter to this copy constructor. C++ functions use pass-by-value by
 * default. This means that the functions make copies of the given arguments. 
 * This is inefficient (particularly for large objects).
 * Therefore it is normal to pass a reference, (using &) of the parameter, called an "alias".
 * Furthermore, if the parameter cannot be changed, it is good programming practice 
 * to indicate so by using the keyword "const". This keyword prevents it from being changed,
 * i.e., the compiler will complaint if the code tries to change the value of the parameter.

/* The destructor is responsible for deleting any memory that was dynamically
 * allocated by an object. If there is no such memory, no destructor needs to
 * be created (the compiler automatically creates one). 
 * Because this class makes use of dynamically allocated memory
 * i.e., uses pointers when new Node objects are instantiated, it is necessary to write 
 * a destructor. Destructors are identified by the "~" preceding the class name.
 * There can be only one destructor for a class, and it cannot have parameters.
