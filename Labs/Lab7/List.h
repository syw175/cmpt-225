    * default. This means that the functions make copies of the given arguments. 
    * This is inefficient (particularly for large objects).
    * Therefore it is normal to pass a reference, (using &) of the parameter, called an "alias".
    * Furthermore, if the parameter cannot be changed, it is good programming practice 
    * to indicate so by using the keyword "const". This keyword prevents it from being changed,
    * i.e., the compiler will complaint if the code tries to change the value of the parameter.

    * Because this class makes use of dynamically allocated memory
    * i.e., uses pointers when new Node objects are instantiated, it is necessary to write 
    * a destructor. Destructors are identified by the "~" preceding the class name.
    * There can be only one destructor for a class, and it cannot have parameters.
